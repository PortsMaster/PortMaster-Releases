III. Brief Demo Playguide
-------------------------

This tutorial is designed to take you through the demo and to get to grips
with Theme Hospital.

The demo comes with an in-built tutorial to get you started so go through
that first to familiarise yourself with buying objects and building rooms.

Once you have done this, you will have a reception desk and a GP's Office.
These are fine to start with but you will soon need to build more rooms
to diagnose your patients further and then to cure them.

The next room you should build should be a General Diagnosis Room (you'll
find this just under GP's Office in the Diagnosis section of the Build Rooms
Panel).  Build it the same way as you built the GP's Office.  A GP's Office
may not completely diagnose a patient in one go so another diagnosis room
is necessary.  When a patient goes into a diagnosis room, he has a
consultation with the Doctor inside and the Doctor will diagnose him a
certain percentage (you can see this percentage by putting your mouse over
the patient and looking at the information displayed on the panel at the
bottom of the screen).  The diagnosis percentage depends on the consulting
Doctor's ability and seniority.  A patient will keep going to different
diagnosis rooms until he is fully diagnosed and then a doctor in a GP's
Office will tell him where to go for his cure.

To cure patients you must have a special room.  To administer drug cures,
you will need a pharmacy and a Nurse to go in it.  Build these now and you
should start to see patients coming in and, after being diagnosed, being
cured in it.

If the patient has a psychiatric disease, you will need to build a
Psychiatric Room (this can be found either in the Diagnosis or the Treatment
sections of the Build Rooms Panel.  This is because this room can both
diagnose patients and cure psychiatric diseases).  This room requires a
Doctor with a psychiatric skill.  When you are on the Hire Staff Panel and
looking through the Doctors available, you may see a symbol appear that looks
like an open book.  This is an Inkblot Test book and means that that Doctor
is qualified to cure psychiatric diseases.  Hire one to both diagnose and
cure patients in the Psychiatric Room.

The last cure room you will need will be the Inflator Room; this cures Bloaty
Head disease in a very graphic manner.

You will have noticed by now that your staff are becoming tired.  This is
because they are working and have nowhere to rest.   You will need to build
a Staff Room.  It might also be a good idea to build some toilets for your
patients' comfort.  You can also build a Ward where your patients will rest
and gain some more diagnosis from a nurse.

Patients do not like standing up so furnish your corridors by buying benches.
Also, buy drinks machines from the Furnish Corridors Panel (click on the
Furnish Corridors button at the bottom of the screen).

Remember to click on the pop-up icons that will appear over the icons panel
at the bottom of the screen.  These give you valuable information about your
patients.  Often patients will not be completely diagnosed because there
aren't enough diagnosis rooms to discover the strain of their disease.  They
will be diagnosed a certain percentage and you will then have the choice of
either sending them home or taking a chance on a cure.  If the patient is
40% diagnosed then there will be a 4 in 10 chance he will be cured but there
is also a 6 in 10 chance he will die.

You have to cure 20 patients in a year in this demo so look after your
patients well and provide for their every need.


IV. Troubleshooting
-------------------

Q: Buttons are flashing at the bottom of the screen!
A: The tutorial mode is operating. Either follow the tutorial or quit and
start again, making sure it is not on.

Q: Furniture doesn't fit in the room I've just built.
A: If re-arranging the furniture doesn't help, your room is too small. You
can resize it by returning to the blueprint stage. It's unwise to build a
room smaller than 4x4 squares and some rooms, like Wards, should be at least
6x6 squares large.

Q: I've got Bloaty Head Patients but they're not going to the Inflation room!
A: Patients must be diagnosed, even when they've got something obviously
wrong with them, like Bloaty Head. The first thing to check is that there
are enough GP's Offices and General Diagnosis Rooms available. Some diseases
can't be diagnosed in some rooms.

Q: I've got lots of Patients in my Hospital doing nothing!
A: Chances are, you've got a big queue at your Receptionist. Build more
Reception desks and hire more Receptionists. Also check your queue sizes,
especially on the GP's Offices, as they can fill up quite quickly and build
more. You may also have not enough Doctors so look around and, if too many
rooms are empty that shouldn't be, hire some more staff.

Q: All my Patients are vomiting!
A: They are sick of the sight of you. You didn't hire enough Handymen. If
you are quick and hire a few more then you may be able to keep it under
control. For a quick fix, grab one, and drop him on top of a pile of sick.
He'll soon sweep it up!

Q: How can I gain more reputation?
A: Reputation is based on individual cure reputations and prices, number of
Patients cured (in each individual disease as well), number of deaths and
good diagnosis' and a few more things. Improve in all these areas to get more.

Q: All my plants are dying!
A: Plants are watered by the Handymen. You don't have to tell them to do this
but watering them takes up valuable time which could be spent clearing
litter. Hire more Handymen, or change their priorities.

Q: Why are some of my staff walking off? I didn't sack them!
A: Staff resign if they are fed up. A pop-up icon appears. If you do not
left-click on the icon after a month then the icon disappears and the member
of staff walks out. You can see if a member of staff is resigning because
they have an special icon above their heads. It could be that your Policy
Screen is particularly harsh on their Staff Rest levels. You may also want
to keep an eye on Staff Management in the future too.

Q: Everything is just going wrong! I can't handle this!
A: Get a grip! Pull yourself together. Practice makes perfect. Are there
buttons you haven't pressed yet? Is your drug casebook up to scratch? How
fast are you at building rooms? What are you, human being or rat?
